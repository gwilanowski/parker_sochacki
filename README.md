The implementation of the giant squid axon and the Booth model with
the Parker-Sochacki method combined with cubic splines interpolation
of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. Contact gwilanowski@ibib.waw.pl if
you have any questions about the implementation of the model.

Usage:
1. Unzip wilanowski2013.zip into empty directory.
2. Run simulation.m MATLAB script
3. A menu will appear that offers a selection of models (the giant
squid axon or the Booth model
4. Choose 1 for HH model or 2 for Booth model. Curve Fitting Toolbox is required.

The program runs on Windows. It bases upon 
Numerical Integration of Izhikevich and HH model neurons (Stewart and Bair 2009)
